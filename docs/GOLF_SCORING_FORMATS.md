- **Modified Formats**: Many amateur events use modified versions of official formats to suit local preferences

## Tournament Strategy Considerations

### Professional Events
- Stroke Play: Consistency and avoiding big numbers
- Match Play: Aggressive play often rewarded; each hole is independent
- Modified Stableford: Encourages risk-taking for birdies and eagles

### Amateur Events
- Scrambles: Strategic order of play (weakest first, strongest last)
- Quota/Stableford: Focus on scoring points rather than avoiding bogeys
- Team formats: Pairing complementary skills (long driver with accurate putter)
