# Handicap Engine Test Documentation

## Overview
This document describes all available handicap types in the Golf X Handicap Engine, their Match Handicap calculation logic, and PMHP (Player Match Hole Par) distribution methods.

## Complete Flow
```
Course Handicap → Match Handicap Calculation → PMHP Distribution
```

## Handicap Types Available (7 Types)

### 1. **Match Play** (`match_play`)
Traditional match play with relative handicaps

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 100% of Course Handicap
- **Formula**: `Course Handicap - Lowest Course Handicap`
- **Why 100%?**: Match play is head-to-head competition where full handicaps ensure fair competition
- **Relative Adjustment**: YES - Lowest player plays off scratch (0)

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Method**: Stroke Index Distribution
- **Logic**: Strokes allocated to hardest holes first (lowest SI)
- **Why**: Rewards good play on difficult holes, traditional match play strategy

#### Example
```
Players:
- Player A: Course HC 10 → Match HC 0
- Player B: Course HC 15 → Match HC 5
- Player C: Course HC 22 → Match HC 12

PMHP for Player B (MH=5):
Holes with SI 1-5 get +1 stroke to par
Hole 4 (Par 5, SI 1): PMHP = 6
Hole 13 (Par 5, SI 2): PMHP = 6
Hole 8 (Par 5, SI 3): PMHP = 6
```

---

### 2. **Stroke Play** (`stroke_play`)
Traditional stroke play tournament format

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 95% of Course Handicap
- **Formula**: `Course Handicap × 0.95`
- **Why 95%?**: Reduces advantage of higher handicappers in large fields
- **Relative Adjustment**: NO - Each player keeps their adjusted handicap

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Method**: Stroke Index Distribution
- **Logic**: Same as match play - strokes to hardest holes first
- **Why**: Maintains consistency and fairness across all holes

#### Example
```
Players:
- Player A: Course HC 10 → Match HC 10 (9.5 rounds up)
- Player B: Course HC 15 → Match HC 14 (14.25 rounds down)
- Player C: Course HC 22 → Match HC 21 (20.9 rounds up)

PMHP for Player B (MH=14):
Holes with SI 1-14 get +1 stroke to par
All holes except SI 15,16,17,18 receive a stroke
```

---

### 3. **Scratch Golf** (`none`)
Pure skill competition with no handicaps

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 0% (No handicap)
- **Formula**: `0` for all players
- **Why 0%?**: Tests pure golfing ability
- **Relative Adjustment**: N/A - Everyone plays at 0

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Method**: None - No strokes to distribute
- **Logic**: PMHP = Hole Par for all holes
- **Why**: No handicap means no stroke adjustments

#### Example
```
All players: Match HC 0
PMHP for all holes = Hole Par
Hole 1 (Par 4): PMHP = 4
Hole 2 (Par 4): PMHP = 4
Hole 3 (Par 3): PMHP = 3
```

---

### 4. **Lucky Draw** (`random`)
Fun mode with controlled randomness for playable chaos

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 95% of Course Handicap (same as Stroke Play)
- **Formula**: `Course Handicap × 0.95`
- **Why 95%?**: Keeps handicaps fair, randomness only in distribution
- **Relative Adjustment**: NO - Each player keeps adjusted handicap

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Method**: Controlled Random Distribution
- **Logic**: Random allocation with caps to ensure playability
- **Why**: Creates unpredictability while keeping game fun and fair

#### Control Rules
|Player Match HC | Max Strokes/Hole | Min Holes w/Strokes | Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1-9 | 1 | 0 | Simple random |
| 10-18 | 2 | MH/2 (min 9) | Spread with doubles |
| 19-27 | 2 | 10+ | Balanced spread |
| 28-36 | 3 | 12+ | Most holes affected |
| 37+ | 3 | 15+ | Nearly all holes |

#### Distribution Algorithm
```
1. Calculate max strokes per hole based on MH range
2. Determine minimum holes needed (MH / max_per_hole)
3. Randomly select which holes get strokes
4. Distribute evenly first, then allocate remainder
5. Never exceed cap per hole
```

#### Example
```
Players:
- Player A: Course HC 10 → Match HC 10 (9.5 rounds up)
- Player B: Course HC 22 → Match HC 21 (20.9 rounds up)

PMHP for Player B (MH=21, controlled random):
- Max 2 strokes per hole (19-27 range)
- Min 11 holes must have strokes
- Random selection, NOT based on SI

Possible distribution:
Holes: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
PMHP:  4  6  3  7  4  4  5  5  4  6  6  3  7  4  6  3  5  4
       0  2  0  2  0  0  2  0  0  2  2  0  2  0  2  0  0  0
(11 holes with strokes, max 2 per hole, total = 21)
```

### 5. **Ghost Mode - Personal Best** (`ghost` with `personal_best`)
Compete against your best previous round

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 100% for real players
- **Formula**:
  - Real players: `Course Handicap` (no relative adjustment)
  - Ghost player: Retrieved from historical best round
- **Why 100%?**: Simulates playing against yourself at your best
- **Relative Adjustment**: NO - Ghost and players keep full handicaps

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Real Players**: Stroke Index Distribution
- **Ghost Player**: No distribution - uses actual scorecard
  - PMHP = Actual score from best round on each hole
  - Not calculated or distributed - it's their real performance

#### Example
```
Real Player: Course HC 15 → Match HC 15
Ghost (You): Best round data from database

Real Player PMHP (SI distribution):
Holes SI 1-15 get +1 stroke

Ghost PMHP (historical):
Hole 1: Shot 4 on Par 4 → PMHP = 4
Hole 2: Shot 5 on Par 4 → PMHP = 5
Hole 3: Shot 3 on Par 3 → PMHP = 3
```

---

### 6. **Ghost Mode - Friend's Best** (`ghost` with `friend_best`)
Compete against a friend's best round

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 100% for real players
- **Formula**: Same as Personal Best but uses friend's data
- **Why 100%?**: Fair comparison between different skill levels
- **Relative Adjustment**: NO - Each keeps their handicap

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Real Players**: Stroke Index Distribution
- **Ghost Friend**: No distribution - uses friend's actual scorecard
- **Friend Selection**: Must select specific friend from list

#### Example
```
Real Player: Course HC 12 → Match HC 12
Ghost (Friend): Friend's best round data

Real Player PMHP: SI 1-12 get strokes
Ghost Friend PMHP: Friend's actual scores per hole
```

---

### 7. **Ghost Mode - Course Record** (`ghost` with `course_record`)
Compete against the course record holder

#### Match Handicap Calculation
- **Allowance Applied**: 100% for real players
- **Formula**: `Course Handicap` for players, record holder's handicap for ghost
- **Why 100%?**: Maximum challenge against best performance
- **Relative Adjustment**: NO - Absolute comparison

#### PMHP Distribution Method
- **Real Players**: Stroke Index Distribution
- **Ghost Record**: No distribution - uses record holder's actual scorecard
- **Challenge**: Highest difficulty level

#### Example
```
Real Player: Course HC 18 → Match HC 18
Ghost (Record): Course record holder's scores

Real Player PMHP: All holes get +1 stroke
Ghost Record PMHP: Record holder's actual scores
```

## Distribution Methods Summary

| Game Type | Match HC Distribution | PMHP Distribution Method |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Match Play | 100%, relative to lowest | Stroke Index |
| Stroke Play | 95%, no relative | Stroke Index |
| Scratch | 0% | None (Par only) |
| Lucky Draw | 95%, no relative | Controlled Random |
| Ghost Personal | 100%, no relative | SI for real, Actual scorecard for ghost |
| Ghost Friend | 100%, no relative | SI for real, Actual scorecard for ghost |
| Ghost Record | 100%, no relative | SI for real, Actual scorecard for ghost |

---

## Key Formulas

### Match Handicap by Type
```
Match Play:   CH × 100% - min(all CH)
Stroke Play:  CH × 95%
Scratch:      0
Lucky Draw:   CH × 95% (same as stroke play)
Ghost:        CH × 100% (no relative)
```

### PMHP Calculation
```
Standard: PMHP = Hole Par + Strokes Received
Ghost: PMHP = Historical Score (actual)
```

### Strokes on Hole (Stroke Index Method)
```
If Match HC >= SI: +1 stroke
If Match HC >= 18 + SI: +2 strokes
If Match HC >= 36 + SI: +3 strokes
```

## Testing on the Test Page

**URL**: http://localhost:5173/test/handicap-engine

### What to Check

1. **Match Handicap Column**: Verify correct calculation
2. **PMP Table**: Shows PMHP for each hole
3. **Gray Cells**: Holes receiving strokes
4. **Total Column**: Should equal Par + Match HC

### Test Scenarios

1. **Match Play**: Verify lowest = 0, SI distribution
2. **Stroke Play**: Verify 95%, SI distribution
3. **Scratch**: All PMHP = Par
4. **Random**: Different distribution each run
5. **Ghost**: Historical PMHP for ghost player

---

## Important Notes

- **PMHP** = Player Match Hole Par (personal par for each hole)
- **Two-step process**: Match HC calculation → PMHP distribution
- **Ghost players** use historical data, not calculated distribution
- **Stroke Index** is the default distribution for most formats
- Only **Match Play** uses relative handicap adjustment
