# Handicap Stroke Play – Professional Reference

## Overview  
Handicap Stroke Play (Net Stroke Play) is a format where each player competes against the course and the field using their full handicap. The handicap is distributed across all 18 holes according to stroke index, ensuring players of varying abilities can compete equitably.

---

## Required Inputs  
- **Handicap Index (HI)**  
- **Slope Rating (Slope)**  
- **Course Rating (CR)**  
- **Par (Par)**  
- **Stroke Index (SI[1–18])**  

---

## Step 1: Course Handicap (CH)  

\[
CH = HI \times \frac{Slope}{113} + (CR - Par)
\]  

Round to the nearest whole number.

---

## Step 2: Playing Handicap (PH)  
For Stroke Play:  

\[
PH = CH \quad (100\% \ allowance)
\]

---

## Step 3: Stroke Allocation  
For a player with **S = PH**:  
1. If **S ≥ 18** → assign 1 stroke on all 18 holes, then reduce S by 18. Repeat until S < 18.  
2. Assign the remaining strokes (S) to the hardest holes (SI = 1…S).  

**Examples:**  
- S = 7 → strokes on SI 1–7.  
- S = 25 → 1 stroke on all 18 holes, plus extra on SI 1–7.  

---

## Step 4: Net Score Calculation  
- **Net Score (hole)** = Gross Score – Strokes Allocated (if any).  
- **Net Total** = Sum of Net Scores for all 18 holes.  

---

## Step 5: Scoring Rules  
- Compare **Net Totals** against par and other players.  
- Lowest **Net Total** wins.  
- Ties are broken using competition rules (e.g., back-9 countback).

---

## Example Calculation  
**Inputs**  
- Player A: HI = 12.3  
- Player B: HI = 25.4  
- Tees: Slope = 130, CR = 72.1, Par = 72  

**Course Handicaps**  
- A: (12.3 × 130 / 113) + 0.1 ≈ 14 → **14**  
- B: (25.4 × 130 / 113) + 0.1 ≈ 29 → **29**  

**Stroke Allocation**  
- Player A: 1 stroke on SI 1–14  
- Player B: 1 stroke on all 18, plus an extra on SI 1–11  

**Scoring (Hole 5, SI = 2)**  
- Gross A = 5 → Net = 4 (5–1)  
- Gross B = 6 → Net = 4 (6–2)  
- Against par 4 → both play the hole “net par.”

## Quick Checklist  
1. Compute CH.  
2. PH = CH.  
3. Allocate strokes across holes using SI.  
4. Subtract strokes from gross scores to get net.  
5. Sum all net scores.  
6. Lowest net wins.

And remember..

> *“Stroke play demands patience. Every shot counts, every mistake lingers. Play your game, trust your handicap, and remember—you’re always in it until the last putt drops.”*
