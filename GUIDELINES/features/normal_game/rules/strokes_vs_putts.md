# Strokes vs. Putts – Information for Scoring

## Overview

In golf scoring, every action counts as a **stroke**, but putts are tracked separately as a useful statistic. This allows players to analyze performance both overall and specifically on the green.

---

## Strokes (Total Shots)

* Definition: Every shot taken, from tee to green.
* Includes: Drives, approach shots, chips, bunker shots, and putts.
* On the scorecard or in the app, this represents the **total number of strokes** taken on the hole.

---

## Putts (Subset of Strokes)

* Definition: Strokes made with the putter while the ball is on the green.
* Putts are **a subset of total strokes**, not an additional category.
* Example: On a Par 4, if a player reaches the green in 2 shots and takes 2 putts, the total is 4 strokes, with 2 of them being putts.

## Usage in the App

* **Strokes** → always required, recorded as the total number of shots.
* **Putts** → optional entry for players who want to track on‑green performance.

## Why Track Putts?

* Helps evaluate short game and green performance.
* Common metric in professional and amateur statistics.
* Optional for casual players, but valuable for improving scoring analysis.

## Quick Summary

* **Strokes** = all shots.
* **Putts** = only strokes made with the putter on the green.
* Putts are optional to record, but provide additional insight.
