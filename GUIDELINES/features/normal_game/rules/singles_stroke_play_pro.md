# Singles Stroke Play – Professional Reference

## Overview
Singles Stroke Play is the most common golf competition format. Every stroke counts, and the player with the lowest **net total score** after 18 holes is the winner.

---

## Required Inputs
- **Handicap Index (HI)**
- **Slope Rating (Slope)**
- **Course Rating (CR)**
- **Par (Par)**
- **Stroke Index (SI[1–18])**

---

## Step 1: Course Handicap (CH)

\[
CH = HI \times \frac{Slope}{113} + (CR - Par)
\]

Round to the nearest whole number.

---

## Step 2: Playing Handicap (PH)
For Singles Stroke Play:

\[
PH = CH \quad (100\% \ allowance)
\]

---

## Step 3: Handicap Stroke Allocation
Each player’s strokes are distributed across holes as follows:

- If **CH ≤ 18** → 1 stroke on holes SI = 1…CH.
- If **CH > 18** → 1 stroke on all 18 holes, then a second stroke on SI = 1…(CH – 18). Repeat if CH > 36.

**Examples:**
- CH = 12 → 1 stroke on SI 1–12.
- CH = 22 → 1 stroke on all 18 holes, plus 1 extra on SI 1–4.

---

## Step 4: Hole Scoring
- **Gross Score** = actual strokes taken on a hole.
- **Net Score** = Gross Score – allocated handicap strokes for that hole.

---

## Step 5: Round Scoring
1. Add all **gross scores** → Gross Total.
2. Add all **net scores** → Net Total.
3. Lowest **Net Total** wins.

---

## Example Calculation
**Inputs**
- Player A: HI = 10.3 → CH ≈ 10
- Player B: HI = 22.5 → CH ≈ 23

**Allocation**
- Player A: 1 stroke on SI 1–10.
- Player B: 1 stroke on all 18 holes, plus extra strokes on SI 1–5.

**Scoring (Hole 1, SI = 1)**
- Gross A = 5 → Net = 5 – 1 = 4
- Gross B = 6 → Net = 6 – 2 = 4
- Result: Hole halved (on net).

---

## Quick Checklist
1. Compute CH.
2. PH = CH.
3. Allocate strokes across holes using SI.
4. Record gross and net scores per hole.
5. Add totals → lowest net wins.

> *“Stroke play is a marathon. Every shot matters. Stay patient, respect the grind, and keep stacking good swings—the scoreboard will take care of itself.”*
