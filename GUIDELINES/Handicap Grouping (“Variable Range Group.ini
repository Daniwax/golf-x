Handicap Grouping (“Variable Range Grouping Function”)

Definition:
To ensure fairness in comparative scoring and grouping, players are allocated into handicap bands using a variable range that expands proportionally with handicap level. This recognizes the decreasing precision and increasing variance of higher handicaps.

Rule:
Let H = player’s Handicap Index.
Define grouping tolerance T(H) as:

𝑇
(
𝐻
)
=
max
⁡
(
3
,
  
round
(
0.2
×
𝐻
)
)
T(H)=max(3,round(0.2×H))

Application:

Each player is compared to others within ±T(H).

For organizational simplicity, bands can be constructed by defining intervals centered on multiples of 5 or 10, adjusted by T(H).

Examples:

If H = 6 → T(H) = max(3, 1.2) = 3 → Group = 3–9.

If H = 15 → T(H) = 3 → Group = 12–18.

If H = 30 → T(H) = 6 → Group = 24–36.

If H = 40 → T(H) = 8 → Group = 32–48.

Interpretation:

Low-handicap players are grouped within narrower ranges, reflecting higher consistency where each stroke is significant.

Mid- to high-handicap players are grouped with broader tolerance, recognizing greater variance in scoring.
