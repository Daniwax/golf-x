## Overview
Skins is a thrilling format where each hole has a value (skin) that goes to the outright winner. Ties carry the skin forward, creating increasing pressure.

## How It Works
- Each hole is worth a "skin"
- Must win hole **outright** (no ties)
- Tied holes **carry over** to next hole
- Carried skins accumulate for bigger prizes

## Calculation Example
**Skin Values (Equal):**
- Hole 1: Player A wins (1 skin)
- Hole 2: Tied - carries over
- Hole 3: Tied - carries over  
- Hole 4: Player B wins (3 skins!)
- Hole 5: Player C wins (1 skin)

**Final Tally:**
- Player A: 1 skin
- Player B: 3 skins
- Player C: 1 skin

## Scoring Details
**Variations:**
- **No Carry:** Tied holes split or void
- **Validation:** Need birdie or better to win
- **Progressive:** Later holes worth more
- **Team Skins:** Best ball format

**Value Options:**
- Equal value per hole
- Back nine worth double
- Progressive increase each hole

## When to Use
**Best for:** Gambling games, adding excitement to regular rounds, groups who want hole-by-hole drama, or when you want every hole to matter independently.

## Strategic Notes
- One great hole can win multiple skins
- Pressure builds with carryovers
- Aggressive play often necessary
- Know when skins are on the line
- Late holes become crucial with carryovers
