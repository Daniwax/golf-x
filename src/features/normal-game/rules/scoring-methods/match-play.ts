## Overview
Match Play is a hole-by-hole competition where you earn points for winning individual holes. The player who wins the most holes wins the match.

## How It Works
- Win a hole = **2 point**
- Tie a hole = **1 points** (hole is "halved")
- Lose a hole = **0 points**
- Most points after 18 holes wins


## Scoring Details
**Winning a Hole:**
- Lowest net score wins the hole
- Gross score if no handicap
- Concessions allowed (given putts)
- No carryover - each hole stands alone

## When to Use
**Best for:** Head-to-head competition, team matches, bracket tournaments, or when you want dramatic hole-by-hole competition rather than cumulative scoring.

## Strategic Notes
- A bad hole only costs one point
- Aggressive play often rewarded
- Psychology matters - pressure mounts
- Know when to concede putts
- Match status affects strategy
