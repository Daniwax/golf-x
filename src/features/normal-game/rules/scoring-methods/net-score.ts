## Overview
Net Score is the most straightforward scoring method. Your total strokes minus your handicap strokes equals your net score. Lowest net score wins.

## How It Works
- Count **every stroke** taken during the round
- Subtract handicap strokes from gross score
- Compare net scores to determine winner
- Simple and universally understood

## Calculation Example
**18-Hole Round:**
- Gross Score: 92 strokes
- Handicap Strokes: 18
- **Net Score: 74**

**Determining Winner:**
- Player A: Net 74
- Player B: Net 76
- Player C: Net 73 (Winner)

## Scoring Details
**Per Hole Scoring:**
- Record actual strokes on each hole
- Apply handicap strokes where allocated
- Sum all holes for total net score
- No maximum score per hole (unless local rules)

## When to Use
**Best for:** Traditional stroke play competitions, qualifying rounds, and when you want the most accurate measure of performance. Standard for most club competitions.

## Strategic Notes
- Every stroke counts equally
- Consistency is key to low net scores
- Avoid big numbers on any hole
- Course management beats aggressive play
- Know your handicap stroke holes
