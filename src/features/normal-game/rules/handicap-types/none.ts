## Overview
No Handicap means all players compete on equal terms with no stroke adjustments. Everyone plays to the course par, making it a pure test of golf skill.

## How It Works
- **No strokes** are given or received
- All players compete with their **gross scores** only
- The player with the **lowest gross score** wins
- Course difficulty affects all players equally

## Calculation Example
**Players and Scores:**
- Player A: 78 strokes (6 over par)
- Player B: 82 strokes (10 over par)
- Player C: 75 strokes (3 over par)

**Winner:** Player C with 75 strokes

## Stroke Distribution
No stroke distribution applies - everyone plays each hole at its designated par:
- Par 3 = 3 strokes expected
- Par 4 = 4 strokes expected
- Par 5 = 5 strokes expected
- No adjustments based on difficulty

## When to Use
**Best for:** Players of similar skill levels, professional tournaments, or when you want to see true performance without adjustments. Also good for practice rounds.

## Strategic Notes
- Raw skill determines the outcome
- No safety net for bad holes
- Course knowledge becomes more important
- Weather conditions affect everyone equally
- Mental toughness is paramount
