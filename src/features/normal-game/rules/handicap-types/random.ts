## Overview
Random Handicap adds an element of chance to the game by distributing strokes randomly among players. Perfect for casual rounds where fun takes priority over competition.

## How It Works
- Strokes are **randomly assigned** each round
- Distribution changes every game for variety
- Can level the playing field unexpectedly
- Adds excitement and unpredictability

## Calculation Example
**Random Distribution (changes each game):**
- Player A (10 hcp): Gets 15 strokes today
- Player B (18 hcp): Gets 8 strokes today
- Player C (25 hcp): Gets 20 strokes today

**Next Game Could Be:**
- Player A: 5 strokes
- Player B: 25 strokes
- Player C: 12 strokes

## Stroke Distribution
Random allocation methods:
- Total strokes: 0-36 assigned randomly
- Holes receiving strokes follow SI order
- Distribution revealed at game start
- Same random seed for fairness in a round

## When to Use
**Best for:** Social golf, charity events, team building, or when you want to mix things up. Great for groups with widely varying skills who want equal winning chances.

## Strategic Notes
- Embrace the chaos - it's meant to be fun
- Good players might struggle, beginners might excel
- Focus on enjoying the round
- Perfect for trying new strategies
- Keeps everyone engaged regardless of skill
