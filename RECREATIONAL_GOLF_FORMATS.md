# Recreational Golf Scoring Formats

## Traditional Betting/Competition Formats

### 1. **Skins Game**
- **Description**: Each hole is worth a "skin" (point or money value)
- **Rules**: The player with the lowest score on a hole wins the skin. If players tie, the skin carries over to the next hole
- **Why it's fun**: Creates dramatic moments with multiple skins on the line; every hole matters independently

### 2. **Nassau**
- **Description**: Three separate bets in one round - front 9, back 9, and overall 18
- **Rules**: Low score wins each of the three matches. Often played with "presses" (double-or-nothing side bets)
- **Why it's fun**: Multiple chances to win; can recover from a bad start; keeps competition alive throughout

### 3. **Wolf**
- **Description**: Rotating captain format where one player chooses partners or plays alone
- **Rules**: 
  - Players rotate being the "Wolf" each hole
  - Wolf tees off last and can choose a partner after their tee shot or go "Lone Wolf"
  - Lone Wolf wins = 4 points; Wolf + partner win = 2 points each
  - If Wolf team loses, opponents get 3 points (1 point if Lone Wolf loses)
- **Why it's fun**: Strategic partnership decisions; risk/reward of going alone; constantly changing teams

### 4. **Vegas**
- **Description**: Team format where scores are combined into two-digit numbers
- **Rules**: 
  - Two teams of two players
  - Combine team scores (e.g., 4 and 6 becomes 46, not 10)
  - Lower number goes first (46 beats 56)
  - Differences in combined scores determine points won/lost
- **Why it's fun**: Scores can swing dramatically; one bad shot affects the whole team; high stakes potential

### 5. **Bingo Bango Bongo**
- **Description**: Points-based game rewarding three achievements per hole
- **Rules**:
  - Bingo = First player on the green (1 point)
  - Bango = Closest to pin once all are on green (1 point)  
  - Bongo = First to hole out (1 point)
- **Why it's fun**: Equalizes different skill levels; rewards good shots regardless of score; keeps everyone engaged

## Points-Based Formats

### 6. **Stableford**
- **Description**: Points awarded based on score relative to par
- **Rules**:
  - Standard scoring: Double bogey or worse = 0; Bogey = 1; Par = 2; Birdie = 3; Eagle = 4; Albatross = 5
  - Modified versions can adjust point values
- **Why it's fun**: Rewards aggressive play; one bad hole doesn't ruin the round; positive scoring feels good

### 7. **Dots/Garbage/Trash**
- **Description**: Collection of small side bets for various achievements
- **Rules**: Points awarded for things like:
  - Closest to pin
  - Longest drive
  - Sandy (up and down from bunker)
  - Greenie (green in regulation on par 3)
  - Birdie or better
- **Why it's fun**: Multiple ways to win points; celebrates good shots; adds excitement to every aspect

### 8. **Rabbit**
- **Description**: Player holding the "rabbit" at end of 9 holes wins
- **Rules**:
  - First player to win a hole outright gets the rabbit
  - Rabbit transfers to any player who wins a hole outright
  - Player with rabbit after holes 9 and 18 wins the bet
- **Why it's fun**: Creates tension on every hole; can change hands frequently; dramatic finishes

## Team Formats

### 9. **Best Ball/Four Ball**
- **Description**: Each player plays their own ball; team takes best score
- **Rules**: Both players play normally, lowest score counts for the team
- **Why it's fun**: Less pressure; can recover from partner's bad shots; allows aggressive play

### 10. **Scramble**
- **Description**: Team format where everyone hits from the best shot
- **Rules**:
  - All players tee off
  - Choose best shot, everyone plays from there
  - Repeat until holed
- **Why it's fun**: Very social; helps weaker players; typically leads to low scores

### 11. **Alternate Shot (Foursomes)**
- **Description**: Partners alternate hitting the same ball
- **Rules**: One player tees off on odd holes, other on even holes; alternate shots until holed
- **Why it's fun**: True teamwork required; builds camaraderie; strategic tee shot assignments

### 12. **Chapman/Pinehurst**
- **Description**: Modified alternate shot format
- **Rules**:
  - Both players tee off
  - Switch balls for second shot (A plays B's ball, B plays A's ball)
  - Choose best ball after second shot and play alternate shot from there
- **Why it's fun**: More forgiving than pure alternate shot; strategic decisions; both players stay involved

## Creative/Arcade Formats

### 13. **Match Play**
- **Description**: Hole-by-hole competition rather than total strokes
- **Rules**: Win, lose, or tie each hole; most holes won takes the match
- **Why it's fun**: Can take risks; conceded putts speed play; momentum swings

### 14. **String It Out**
- **Description**: Each player gets a length of string to improve lies
- **Rules**: Use string to move ball (string is consumed by distance moved)
- **Why it's fun**: Strategic use of limited resource; helps with bad lies; adds unique element

### 15. **Worst Ball**
- **Description**: Opposite of best ball - team must count worst score
- **Rules**: Both players play, higher score counts
- **Why it's fun**: Hilarious and humbling; great for laughs; levels playing field

### 16. **Speed Golf**
- **Description**: Combination of golf score and time taken
- **Rules**: Final score = strokes + minutes taken to complete round
- **Why it's fun**: Adds fitness element; quick decision making; completely different strategy

### 17. **One Club Challenge**
- **Description**: Play entire round with only one club
- **Rules**: Choose any single club and play every shot with it
- **Why it's fun**: Tests creativity; hilarious results; great equalizer

### 18. **Nine Points**
- **Description**: Distribute 9 points among players each hole based on performance
- **Rules**: Best score gets 5 points, second gets 3, third gets 1 (adjust for group size)
- **Why it's fun**: Every stroke matters; rewards consistency; simple scoring

## Why These Formats Work

1. **Engagement**: Keep all players involved regardless of skill level
2. **Variety**: Different formats emphasize different skills
3. **Social**: Many encourage interaction and team play
4. **Risk/Reward**: Create strategic decisions beyond just hitting good shots
5. **Recovery**: Bad holes or shots don't necessarily ruin the entire game
6. **Excitement**: Add drama and pressure to routine rounds
